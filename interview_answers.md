# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?

Prop drilling

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Actions act as functions, reducers act as pointers/directors, and the store is the directory. It is known as a single source of truth because it contains all the ways global state can be changed.

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

Allows us to call actions creators that return a function.

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

I was sick on Tuesday, introduction to redux, so I have been playing catch-up all week and still feel far behind. I like the reducer pattern, as it was the only thing I learned this week, despite my best efforts and the efforts of the helpful people around me. I do not have a grip on redux, not to mention async redux and middleware. I'm trying my hardest to complete this sprint challenge and learn redux with this week's GPs over the weekend.
